"ID36"	"	-Method section of the paper:"	"Muscles were mechanically disaggregated and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing liberase (Roche, 177246) and dispase (Gibco, 17105-041) at 37 °C with agitation for 1–2 h. When required, SPiDER-β-gal reagent (Dojindo, SG02; 1 μM) was added during the second hour. The supernatant was then filtered and cells were incubated in lysis buffer (BD Pharm Lyse, 555899) for 10 min on ice, resuspended in PBS with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and counted. BV711-conjugated anti-CD45 (BD, 563709; 1:200), APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-F4/80 (BioLegend, 123118; 1:200), PE-conjugated anti-α7-integrin (Ablab, AB10STMW215; 1:200), APC-conjugated anti-CD31 (eBiosci- ence, 17-0311-82; 1:200) and PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-SCA1 (BioLegend, 108114; 1:200) antibodies were used to isolate MCs (CD45+F4/80+), SCs (α7-integrin+CD45−F4/80−CD31−) and FAPs (SCA1+CD45−F4/80−α7-integrin−CD31−). PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies (Bio- Legend, 103114) were used to isolate CD45-positive and CD45-negative populations. SPiDER-β-gal (SPiDER) was used to isolate senescent cells (SPiDER+) from non-senescent cells (SPiDER−) of each cell type. Cells were sorted using the FACS Aria II (BD) system. Cell lineage was con- firmed by specific-cell marker expression. Isolated cells were used either for RNA extraction, cell cultures, engraft- ments, proliferation assays or plated onto glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 177402) for immunostaining and SA-β-gal analysis."
"ID37"	"             - Prior processing steps if applicable: <e.g. trimming/merging reads etc>"	"Sequencing reads were preprocessed using the nf-core/rnaseq (v.1.2) pipeline58. Read quality was assessed using FastQC (v.0.11.8)59. Trim Galore (v.0.5.0)60 was used to trim sequencing reads, eliminating the remains of Illumina adaptors and discarding reads that were shorter than 20 bp. The resulting reads were mapped onto the mouse genome (GRCm38, Ensembl61 release 81) using HiSAT2 (v.2.1.0)62 and quan- tified using featureCounts (v.1.6.2)63. Reads per kilobase per mil- lion mapped reads (RPKM) and transcripts per million (TPM) gene expression values were calculated from the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM)-normalized counts per million (CPM) values using the Biocon- ductor package edgeR (v.3.30.0)64 and R (v.4.0.0)65. Differential gene expression analysis and PCA were performed using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (v.1.28.1)66. Variance-stabilizing transformation of count data was applied to visualize the sample-to-sample distances in PCA. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if showed an adjusted P < 0.05."
